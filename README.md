<h1>Introduction to Java Programming 8th Edition</h1>
<p>These are my solutions to the exercises in the book. I am revisiting the book to regain my footing and knowledge with the Java programming language and programming in general.</p>
<p>While my experience is not that of a beginner, I have been out of practice for any major coding for quite a while so revisiting my college text books is where I am getting stuck in again.
I do have a few project ideas I could use for practicing, but I have succumbed to my use it or lose it knowledge retention and have decided to rebuild the foundations stronger than before.</p>
<p>Starting at the very beginnning seems a little redundant but as someone who can tend to get pulled in different directions, I feel its necessary to provide myself that semblence of structure. Also,
being somewhat obsessive compusive about starting from the start and not in the middle, this way satisfies that requirement too. Again, trying to rebuild the foundations so what harm in repeating the basics?</p>
<p>With that in mind I have set some basic rules for myself, for the earlier chapters at least. I will not write code that has not been introduced in the chapter or chapters previous to the one I'm working on.
  There will of course be better solutions and a lack of error handling etc. initally but that should build up the further I progress. I will also try and program using GUIs for the user input instead of the Scanner. I just find the visual feedback more motivating.</p>
