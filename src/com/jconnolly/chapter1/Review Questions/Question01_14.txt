Question:
What is a comment? Is the comment ignored by the compiler? How do you denote a comment line and a comment paragraph?

Answer:
A comment is a piece of information that can tell you what the program is or how it is being constructed. It is helpful for communication between programmers to understand the program.

A compiler ignores text after // on the same line and the text between /* */.

A double forward slash (//) denotes a single line of code. // This is a comment line.

An opening forward slash and star (/*) and a closing star and forward slash (*/) denotes a comment paragraph. /* This is a comment paragraph. */.
