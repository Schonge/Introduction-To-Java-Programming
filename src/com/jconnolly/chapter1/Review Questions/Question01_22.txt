Question:
Are there any performance differences between the following two import statements?

import javax.swing.JOptionPane;
import javax.swing.*;

Answer:
No there is no difference. The information is not read in at compile or runtime unless the class is used.
The import statement just tells the compiler where to locate the classes.
