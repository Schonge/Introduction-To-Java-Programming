Question:
Translate the following algorithm into Java code:

Step 1: Declare a double variable named miles with an initial value 100.
Step 2: Declare a double constant named MILES_PER_KILOMETER with value 1.609;
Step 3: Declare a double variable named kilometers, multiply miles and MILES_PER_KILOMETER, and assign the result to kilometers.
Step 4: Display kilometers to the console.

What is kilometers after step 4?

Answer:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    double miles = 100;
    final double MILES_PER_KILOMETER = 1.609;
    double kilometers = miles * MILES_PER_KILOMETER;
    System.out.println(miles + " miles is " + kilometers + " kilometers.")
}

Kilometers = 160.9km
