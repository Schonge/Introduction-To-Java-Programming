Question:
What are the benefits of using constants? Declare an int constant SIZE with value 20.

Answer:
1. Don't have to repeatedly type the same value.
2. If you have to change the constant you only need to do it in one place.
3. A descriptive name for a constant makes the program easy to read.

final int SIZE = 20;
