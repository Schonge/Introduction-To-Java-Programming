Question:
Assume that int a = 1 and double d = 1.0 and that each expression is independent.
What are the results of the following expressions?

a = 46 / 9;
a = 46 % 9 + 4 * 4 - 2;
a = 45 + 43 % 5 * (23 * 3 % 2);
a %= 3 / a + 3;

d = 4 + d * d + 4;
d += 1.5 * 3 + (++a);
d -= 1.5 * 3 + a++;

Answer:
1. 5
2. 15
3. 48
4. 0

1. 9.0
2. 15.5
