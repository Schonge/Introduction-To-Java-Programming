Question:
Are the following statements correct? If so, show the output:

System.out.println("25 / 4 is " + 25 / 4);
System.out.println("25 / 4.0 is " + 25 / 4.0);
System.out.println("3 * 2 / 4 is " + 3 * 2 / 4);
System.out.println("3.0 * 2 / 4 is " + 3.0 * 2 / 4);

Answer:
1. 25 / 4 is 6. Technically incorrect as there is a remainder of 1 but it would return the value of 6.
2. 25 / 4.0 is 6.25
3. 3 * 2 / 4 is 1
4. 3.0 * 2 / 4 is 1.5
