Question:
Identify and fix the errors in the following code:

public class Test {
    public void main (string[] args) {
        int i;
        int k = 100.0;
        int j = i + 1;

        System.out.println("j is " + j + " and
            k is " + k);
    }
}

Answer:
Corrected code:

public class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args) {
        int i = 0;
        double k = 100.0;
        int j = i + 1;

        System.out.println("j is " + j + " and k is " + k);
    }
}

Changes made:
1. Corrected the method signature of 'main' to include static and uppercase S in String.
2. Need to initialize int i to 0.
3. Need to change k to a double to match the value 100.0.
4. Corrected the format of 'System.out.println' statement.
