Question:
Can different types of numeric values be used together in a computation?

Answer:
Yes using type casting.

Implict Type Conversion:
    - Happens automatically. If you do a computation between an integer and a double with the result being double the integer is
      automatically promoted to a double. This would not work converting a double to an integer.
      (Converting narrower data type to wider)

Explicit Type Conversion:
    - Requires manual intervention. If you want to assign a double value to an integer you need to explicitly cast it.
      e.g. double i = 1.4;
           int j = (int) i;
