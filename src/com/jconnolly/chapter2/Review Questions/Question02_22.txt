Question:
Evaluate the following:

int i = '1';
int j = '1' + '2';
int k = 'a';
char c = 90;

Answer:
1. Takes the Unicode value of '1' which is decimal 49. i = 49.
2. Takes the Unicode values of '1' and '2' which are decimal 49 and 50 and adds them together. j = 99.
3. Takes the Unicode value of 'a' which is decimal 97. k = 97.
4. Takes the integer 90 and associates it to the Unicode value 'Z'. c = Z.
