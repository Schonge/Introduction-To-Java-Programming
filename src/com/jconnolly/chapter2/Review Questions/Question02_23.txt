Question:
Can the following conversions involving casting be allowed? If so, find the converted result.

char c = 'A';
i = (int)c;

float f = 1000.34f;
int i = (int)f;

double d = 1000.34;
int i = (int)d;

int i = 97;
char c = (char) i;

Answer:
1. Error, i is not initialized.
2. i becomes 1000 (Explicit Type Conversion).
3. i becomes 1000 (Explicit Type Conversion).
4. c becomes a (Explicit Type Conversion the integer value 97 is converted to its corresponding character value of 'a').
