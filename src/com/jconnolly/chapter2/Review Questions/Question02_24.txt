Question:
Show the output of the following program:

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        char x = 'a';
        char y = 'c';

        System.out.println(++x);
        System.out.println(y++);
        System.out.println(x - y);
    }
}

Answer:
Output is b, c, and -2.
'a' value is pre-incremented so x becomes 'b'.
'c' value does not get incremented until after its used in the expression so it remains 'c'.
x and y get converted to their decimal values to perform the calculation x would remain 'a' as it doesn't get reassigned to 'b'.
Same with y. x = 97, y = 99. x - y = -2
