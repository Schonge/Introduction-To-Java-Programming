Question:
Show the output of the following statements (write a program to verify your result):

System.out.println("1" + 1);
System.out.println('1' + 1);
System.out.println("1" + 1 + 1);
System.out.println("1" + (1 + 1));
System.out.println('1' + 1 + 1);

Answer:
1. 11 - String vaue 1 beside number 1. Because it starts as a String it concatenates the 1.
2. 50 - Decimal value of character 1 which is 49 + 1.
3. 111 - String value 1 beside number 1 beside number 1. Because it starts as a String the two 1s are concatenated instead of added.
4. 12 - String value 1 beside result of (1 + 1).
5. 51 - Decimal value of character 1 which is 49 + 1 + 1.
